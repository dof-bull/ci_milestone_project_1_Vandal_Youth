# VANDAL YOUTH Bandsite
by Donal O'Farrell

Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my first attempt at the project. I am aware it is unfinished and I will resubmit an updated and fully functional resubmission once I have caught up on the current course material.

The planning for this project can be found here:

## UX
My design goal with the site was to keep things simple and go with a mobile-first approach. The color scheme was chosen to be bright, fun and to encourage the 60's nostalgia that the band would rely on for marketing and sales. 

For fans, I wanted them to have quick access to the songs and video content and they can access that with just one click from the landing page and with the links being very visible.

For potential bookers, I have have made the bookings section of equal importance on the NavBar and again jsut one click away. I have also created to access points for them to contact the band via the sticky 'Contact us' button in the footer and the large call to action button on the bookings page.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3)


## Features
This site contains built in audio files of the band's greatest hits and direct access to one of their music videos. A modal window is in place to get in contact with the band.


### Features Left to Implement
I still have elements to fully correct their functionality and to tidy up. I would also like to add some quotes for corporate and weddings customers in the booking section.

I still need to create the social media icon links. Have placeholder text in the left of the footer where I will put them in.


## Testing
The fans in the user stories can access to the music files as desired.

The booking form has the 'required' tags for the name, email and message section so these can't be left blank. The email section also needs to recognize a valid email address before you can submit. Accessing the modal window was also tested from all pages and all device sizes.

The navbar connects all pages smoothly and was tested accross full device range.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/dof-bull/ci_milestone_project_1_Vandal_Youth.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
